The Antinori family makes some of the best wines in the world and for those accustomed to paying $80-$120 for premium Napa Cabernet, this might be one of your favorite new wines! Rich, silky and I mean silky smooth and blackberries & dark chocolate throughout this massive effort. Will last for 20-30 years in a cellar.",

    "description": "This Rosso di Montalcino slowly opens to inviting aromatics of cherries and red plums along with spices, leather and hints of wild herbs all coming together seamlessly. On the palate this is silky and polished, continuing to impress with its overall balance. There is a lovey core of sweet red fruits which are lifted by the underlying acidity as it enters the long, pretty finish. This is an outstanding effort which will continue to impress over the next few years.",
